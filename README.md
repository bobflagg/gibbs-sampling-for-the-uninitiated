# Gibbs Sampling for the Uninitiated

The tutorial paper 
[Gibbs Sampling for the Uninitiated](https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/pubs/LAMP-TR-153.pdf)
by Resnik and Hardisty is a masterpiece of exposition.  Their main example provides an amazingly 
clear description of how to build a Gibbs sampler for the very simple Naı̈ve Bayes probabilistic model. 
In this repository I implement their Gibbs sampling in Python, show how to use it to build a SPAM detector, and illustrate
some techniques for optimizing Python code to increase the speed of the sampler by a couple of orders of magnitude.
